# Sample rainfall = [0.0, 5.2, 3.1, 0.0, 12.4, 0.0, 7.5]

# Tasks:
# Convert the list to a NumPy array and print it.
# Print the total rainfall for the week.
# Print the average rainfall for the week.
# Count how many days had no rain (0 mm).
# Print the days (by index) where the rainfall was more than 5 mm.
# Calculate the 75th percentile of the rainfall data and identify values above it. (help : use numpy.percentile())
# Share your GitHub link on Teams when you have done.
